			How this works:
		</p>
		<ul style="">
			<li style="margin-top: 10px; font-size:20px">
				Players in the current list are required to have played in the last 8 weeks, as well as having less than 200 RD (about 6-10 games)
			</li>
			<li style="margin-top: 10px; font-size:20px">
				Every player who has ever played in a tournament has their scores saved in the full rankings list (Ratings start at 1000), but will be excluded from the active list unless they meet the requirements.

			</li>
			<li style="margin-top: 10px; font-size:20px">
				The RD stands for the Rating Deviation, the higher the RD the more rating gained/lost for each win, in addition to being a good guess of how certain we are of a players rating. 
			</li>
			<li style="margin-top: 10px; font-size:20px">
				Uses a version of the method found here <a href="http://aligulac.com/about/faq/">http://aligulac.com/about/faq/</a>, as well as the python code for Glicko2 found here <a href="https://github.com/ryankirkman/pyglicko2">https://github.com/ryankirkman/pyglicko2</a>
